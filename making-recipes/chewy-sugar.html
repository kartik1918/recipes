    <h2>Below is the recipe for Chewy Sugar Cookie</h2>
    <p>Cookies that are crisp on the outside and very chewy on the inside. Do not try to roll these cookies out, they are meant to be shaped or dropped.</p>
    <p>This recipe can easily be made into snickerdoodle cookies by rolling the dough in cinnamon-sugar before baking.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups margarine</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar for decoration</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, and salt; set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and 2 cups sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then the vanilla. Gradually stir in the dry ingredients until just blended.</li>
        <li>Wrap dough with plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and roll the balls in remaining 1/4 cup of sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets and flatten slightly.</li>
        <li>Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned at the edges. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
